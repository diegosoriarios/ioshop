# ioshop

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## TODO

- [] Host the product and shopping carts in [Cloud Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/), and use the [Flutter plugin](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_auth) for [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/) for user authentication.
- [] Use [Dart's gRPC support](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/dart.html) to talk to a cloud hosted API server, for example with [Cloud Endpoints for gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/about-grpc).
- [] If you have an API server that exports an API via JSON REST, see [Andrew Brogdon's Medium post](https://medium.com/flutter-io/some-options-for-deserializing-json-with-flutter-7481325a4450) for a range of options for working with JSON REST APIs.
